# Programming and problem solving
This was block 1-2 from the first semester of computer science. Here I have included the last three of my individual tasks. This course gave me some basics
and essential programming skills. We wrote in the programming language F#, which is a language that combines imperative and functional programming.

For each task I have attached the task text. The assignment text itself consists of a series of practice tasks that have nothing to do with the submission itself,
the actual description for the delivery is at the bottom under the section: "Delivery tasks"
