This was a group assignment from the course CompSys in block 1-2 from the third semester, where we had to implement a RISC-V compiler that could read RISC-V
commands from the base instruction set and the extension for multiplication, convert them to C code, and finally execute the code. RISC-V is one
low-level language that is a descendant of assembly. The simulate.c file reads a .dis file one command at a time, delegating each command to a specific one
function that implements the given RISC-V command.

I have attached the actual task description as a pdf if it could be of interest
